It adds resolve and post methods to **pydantic** and **dataclass** objects.\\n\\nProblems to solve\\n\\nIf you have ever written similar code and felt unsatisfied, pydantic-resolve can come in handy.\\n\\n```python\\nstory_ids = [s.id for s in stories]\\ntasks = await get_all_tasks_by_story_ids(story_ids)\\n\\nstory_tasks = defaultdict(list)\\n\\nfor task in tasks:\\n    story_tasks[task.story_id].append(task)\\n\\nfor story in stories:\\n    tasks = story_tasks.get(story.id, [])\\n    story.tasks = tasks\\n    story.total_task_time = sum(task.time for task in tasks)\\n    story.total_done_tasks_time = sum(task.time for task in tasks if task.done)\\n    story.complex_result = ... calculation with many line\\n```\\n\\nThe problem is, this snippet mixed data fetching, traversal, variables and **business logic** together, which makes the core logic not easy to read.\\n\\npydantic-resolve can help **split them apart**, let developer focus on the core business logic, and leave other jobs to `Resolver().resolve`\\n\\nit introduced `resolve_method` for data fetching and `post_method` for extra midification after fetched.\\n\\nand the TaskLoader can be reused like a common component to load tasks by story_id\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pydantic_resolve import Resolver, LoaderDepend, build_list\\nfrom aiodataloader import DataLoader\\n\\n\\n# data fetching\\nclass TaskLoader(DataLoader):\\n    async def batch_load_fn(self, story_ids):\\n        tasks = await get_all_tasks_by_story_ids(story_ids)\\n        return build_list(tasks, story_ids, lambda t: t.story_id)\\n\\n# core business logics\\nclass Story(Base.Story):\\n    #

Started to learn python and am working on a small project to build a trading system. I took help from various coding AI assistants to build up the different pieces and got it to a working state. However I was using bare SQL queries for all my data management and although I tried to minimise possibilities of error and injections, it was still looking cumbersome. So I wanted to experiment with an ORM and tried sql alchemy. But due to how my table relationships are modelled Im having difficulty figuring out how to express them in a way sql alchemy can understand, none of the AI assistants have been able to help me.\\n\\nBasically it is a hierarchy of Strategy -> StrategySet -> Leg.\\nAnd the Strategy and Leg entities have indirect StopLoss and TrailingStopLoss relationships. I'm not using a dedicated column on the Strategy and Leg entities to reference the StopLoss and TrailingStopLoss as it wouldn't work out. A Strategy or Leg can have multiple stop losses or Trailing Stop losses defined and hence it would be a one to many relationship. \\nSo I modelled the StopLoss and TrailingStopLoss to hold a polymorphic reference called entity type. Depending on the entity type(Strategy or Leg) the entity id could hold reference to a Strategy or Leg id. So now whenever a new StopLoss or TrailingStopLoss is to be created I want to ensure the entity type is validated to be Strategy or Leg and then ensure the corresponding entity id actually exists in Strategy or Leg. \\nI was able to do all of this manually when I wrote the SQL queries myself but now having trouble modelling all of this in SQL alchemy. Any help or advice on what to do? Should I just create dedicated StopLoss and TrailingStopLoss entities for Strategy and Leg separately? I wanted to keep redundant columns or tables to a minimum.\\n\\n\\nHere's the complete code(not working) for more details in case you need it - https://gist.github.com/karthik448/cd5bafb8e4cd5e37d5dfdffe26643d76\\n\\n\\nThe only working code that any of the AIs could do was to add in a stop loss and trailing stop loss reference id into the strategy and leg entities and use the relationship and back-populates to add it in when a stop loss entry is created.
